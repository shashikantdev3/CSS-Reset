# CSS-Reset-and-Custom-properties
## Custom CSS Reset - Whenever I start a new project, the first order of business is to sand down some of the rough edges in the CSS language. I do this with a functional set of custom baseline styles. 

I have added custom properties and general styling as well which should be change according to your project requirements. 

Here I have also added the code for visually-hidden or sr-only(screen reader only) which I have taken from [article by Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html).
